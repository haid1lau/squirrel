"""
scan_jobs.py

What every inbox scan shares, whatever the provider (gmail_sync.py,
imap_sync.py):

- the words that make an email a likely benefit email, and the scan limits;
- background jobs with progress the dashboard polls;
- the per-email step: AI extraction, then storing the benefit, run for
  several emails at once.

Each scan also runs loyalty.detect first (no AI), so memberships are found
even when the AI step can't run.

Limits on what reaches the AI model (and so on API cost):
- An email that looks like a marketing blast (looks_promotional) is skipped
  without calling the model, and never checked again.
- Each user's emails sent to the model are capped per day (DAILY_EMAIL_CAP),
  across every scan and provider, counted in the database. Emails over the cap
  wait for a later scan.

Scan progress lives in memory, so restarting the server mid-scan loses it
(emails already read stay processed).

An email the AI model fails on (a refusal, unusable output) is tried again by
the next scans, at most MAX_TRIES times in all; after that it's skipped, so a
few bad emails can't use up every scan's limit and keep older emails from being
read.
