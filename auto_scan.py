"""
auto_scan.py

The daily scan: scans every connected inbox (Gmail, Outlook, IMAP) once a day,
for users who turn it on. It's off until the user turns it on.

There is no background schedule, so nothing is scanned while the user is
away: a scan only starts when the user opens Squirrel while signed in
(server.py calls maybe_start from /api/session) or turns the daily scan on,
at most once per day in the user's time zone. It has the same limits as
pressing "Scan inbox" (scan_jobs: the daily AI cap and the marketing filter).

Which scans the last daily scan started is kept in memory, for its summary;
a restart forgets it (the scans' results are kept).
